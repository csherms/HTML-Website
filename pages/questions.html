      <h3>CSS Terminology and Definitions</h3>
      <!-- 1 -->
      <li><strong>What are the main differences between external, internal, and inline CSS?</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>An external stylesheet is stored separately from the HTML and attatched to that HTML using a link. This
            keeps the code separated by specific purpose and also make the code more readable. An internal stylesheet is
            contained inside of the HTML file and is done by using the "style" tag. It is not as readable as an external
            sheet. Inline styling is styling the HTML elements themselves right inside of the HTML file. This should be
            done very sparingly, and used only for minor tweaks to certain items.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <!-- 2 -->

            an Id by name.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <!-- 3 -->
      <li><strong>How would you apply a single rule to two different selectors?</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>We can use commas to target multiple selectors and once and make changes to their styling.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <!-- 4 -->
      <li><strong>Given an element that has an id of title and a class of primary, how would you use both
          attributes for a single rule?</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>"#title, .primary" will select both names at the same time.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <!-- 5 -->
      <li><strong>What does the descendant combinator do?</strong>
        <ul>

            contained inside of a division.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <!-- 6 -->
      <li><strong>Between a rule that uses one class selector and a rule that uses three type selectors,
          which rule has the higher specificity?</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>The type selectors will take precident because of the nature of "stacking" their values together.</li>

        <ul>
          <li>It includes the padding and border in an elements total width and height calculations.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <!-- 9 -->
      <li><strong>What is the difference between the standard and alternative box model?</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>If you are using the standard box model, the size of the border is added to the width and height of the
            box. If you are using the alternative box model then the size of the border makes the content box smaller as
            it takes up some of that available width and height.</li>

        </ul>
      </li>
      <!-- 13 -->
      <li><strong>What is the difference between a block element and an inline element?</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Block elements take up the entire available width of the screen and inline elements only take up the space
            they require.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <!-- 14 -->
      <li><strong>What is the difference between an inline element and an inline-block element?</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>The major difference is that display: inline-block allows to set a width and height on the element. Also,
            with display: inline-block , the top and bottom margins/paddings are respected, but with display: inline
            they are not.</li>

          <li>Div's are block-level elements.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <!-- 18 -->
      <li><strong>Is span block or inline?</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Spans are inline-level elements.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <!-- 19 -->
      <li><strong>What’s the difference between a flex container and a flex item?</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>The container is the "housing" of the items. The items laid out as flexible boxes inside the flex
